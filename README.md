# Omnifocus Tag Converter

Simply finds any task that has a note with '#tag' convention, and does a fuzzy match against existing contexts, adding the first found context to the task.

Runs with no options.

I use this to send tasks to OmniFocus using Mail Drop. Task name goes in the subject, #context goes in the body.

Here's a Hazel rule that takes advantage of this:
